Task:
The CSS code for the table is already prepared. Using HTML, your task is to create a table with data about the game results. The table should include:

Table header (<thead>):
Columns: Player, Score, Date.

Table body (<tbody>):
Enter 3 rows (<tr>) with sample results, for example:
Player: “Dawid,” score: “2500 pts,” date: “2025-01-05.”
Player: “Aron,” score: “3000 pts,” date: “2025-01-06.”
Each data cell (<td>) should contain content consistent with the description.
