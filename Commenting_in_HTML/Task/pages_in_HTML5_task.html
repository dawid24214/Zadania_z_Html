<!--Suggested exercise:
Create a page that contains headers (<h1>, <h2>), a paragraph (<p>), an unordered list, an ordered list, and several links.
Use bold and italics in the paragraph, and also use comments to describe sections.
With these basic tags, you can already start building simple webpages, and later you can expand them with more advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques! -->
